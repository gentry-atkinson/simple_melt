# simple_melt

This project is a simple "melty brain" style driver for a 150g robot based on the
Pololu baby orangutan board. This file is being written for Uncle Traveling Matt
but should work for any similar robot.

This is an attempt to design a melty brain that does not rely on an accelerometer
but instead uses the onboard potentiometer to set the spin rate. The robot will
have to be "tuned" before competition.

This isn't the right way to make a melty brain but it's a way to do it if the
SparkFun accelerometer is being a pain in the ass.
